            <h2>How Composting Works</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Step 1: Contact customerservice@a2gov.org or 734.994.7336 to get your free compost cart</li>
                <li>Step 2: 1. Keep a small composting bucket in your kitchen to collect food scraps. If you don't want to clean your bin regularly, then line the bucket with a compostable bag. The bag can easily be tied closed and disposed of in your compost cart and it will break down just as well as the goods inside!</li>
                <li>Step 3: Place your Food scraps, yard trimmings, even newspapers or paper towels into your home compost bin!</li>
                <li>Step 4:  When the time comes, take your compost bin to the curb to be collected by your local compost heroes</li>
                <li>Step 5:  On collection days, your local compost collectors take your compost to the local composting facility </li>
                <li>Step 6: Here in Ann Arbor We Care Denali collects, processes and screens your compost for any pesky contaminates and then start the compost process</li>
                <li>Step 7: After time of mixing and watering which keeps the decomposition process moving, your compostable inputs leave the facility as nutrient rich soil and mulch!</li>
                <li>Step 8: Soils and mulches are used for farming to grow some hearty crops</li>
                <li>Step 9: These crops are turned into healthy food products which can be consumed or even used to make more compostable products! </li>
            </ul>
